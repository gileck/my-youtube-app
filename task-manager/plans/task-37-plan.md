# Task 37: Implement Feature Branch Workflow with Phase PRs - Implementation Plan

## Objective

Refactor the GitHub agents workflow to use feature branches for **multi-phase features only**, providing isolation between concurrent workflows, easier phase reviews, and preview deployments for verification before final merge. Single-phase features remain unchanged.

## Current Architecture

Based on codebase exploration, here is how the system currently works:

### Current Branch Flow
```
main <--- Product Design PR (merged)
main <--- Tech Design PR (merged)
main <--- Phase 1 PR (merged)
main <--- Phase 2 PR (merged)
main <--- Phase 3 PR (merged)
```

### Current GitHub Project Statuses
- `Backlog` - New items, not yet started
- `Product Development` - (Optional) AI transforms vague ideas into product specs
- `Product Design` - AI generates UX/UI design, human reviews
- `Technical Design` - AI generates tech design, human reviews
- `Ready for development` - Implementation (Implementation Phase field tracks multi-PR phases)
- `PR Review` - PR created, awaiting human review/merge
- `Done` - Completed and merged

### Key Components Identified

1. **Implementation Agent** (`src/agents/core-agents/implementAgent/index.ts`)
   - Creates branches: `feature/issue-{N}-phase-{M}-{slug}` or `feature/issue-{N}-{slug}`
   - Creates PRs targeting `main` (via `defaultBranch`)
   - Handles new implementations, feedback addressing, and clarifications
   - Uses `generateBranchName()` for branch naming

2. **PR Review Agent** (`src/agents/core-agents/prReviewAgent/index.ts`)
   - Reviews PRs in "PR Review" status with "Waiting for Review"
   - Submits GitHub PR reviews (APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES)
   - Generates commit messages for merge

3. **GitHub Adapter** (`src/server/project-management/adapters/github.ts`)
   - `createPullRequest(head, base, title, body, reviewers)` - base branch is configurable
   - `findOpenPRForIssue()` - finds open PRs referencing an issue
   - `mergePullRequest()` - squash merges PRs
   - `createBranch()`, `deleteBranch()`, `branchExists()` - branch management

4. **Telegram Webhook** (`src/pages/api/telegram-webhook.ts`)
   - Handles merge actions via callback buttons
   - Primary merge handler (GitHub Action is disabled)

5. **Multi-Phase System** (`src/agents/lib/phases.ts`, `src/agents/lib/artifacts.ts`)
   - Tracks phase progress via `Implementation Phase` field in GitHub Projects
   - Stores phase info in artifact comments on issues
   - Format: `Phase X/Y: Name`

## Approach

### Key Decision: Design to Main, Implementation Splits by Phase Count

Since phases are only determined during Tech Design, we use this approach:
- **Design docs (Product Design, Tech Design)**: Always PR to main (no change)
- **Single-phase implementation**: PR to main (no change)
- **Multi-phase implementation**: Feature branch + Final Review status

This minimizes changes while providing isolation where it matters most.

### New GitHub Project Status: "Final Review"

Add new status between "PR Review" and "Done" for multi-phase features:

| Status | Description | Used By |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| PR Review | Phase PR being reviewed by PR Review Agent | Single & Multi-phase |
| **Final Review** *(NEW)* | Final PR from feature branch to main, admin verifies complete feature | Multi-phase only |
| Done | Merged to main | Single & Multi-phase |

### Status Flow Comparison

**Single-Phase (No Change):**
```
Ready for Dev → PR Review → Done
```

**Multi-Phase (New):**
```
Ready for Dev → PR Review → Ready for Dev → PR Review → ... → Final Review → Done
     (1/N)        (phase 1)      (2/N)        (phase 2)         (final PR)
```

### Architectural Decisions

1. **When to create feature branch**: At start of implementation for multi-phase only (after Tech Design determines phases)
2. **Design docs**: Always to main (no change) - we don't know phase count yet
3. **Single-phase**: Direct to main (no change) - no feature branch overhead
4. **Multi-phase**: Feature branch for isolation, Final Review for admin verification
5. **Branch naming**: `feature/task-{issueId}` for task branch, `feature/task-{issueId}-phase-{N}` for phase branches
6. **Final PR creation**: Automatic after last phase merges to feature branch
7. **Preview URL**: Include in Final Review notification for admin verification

### Logging Requirements

All new feature branch operations MUST be logged to the issue logger for debugging. Use new log markers:

| Marker | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH]` | All feature branch operations (create, PR targeting, merge, cleanup) |
| `[LOG:FINAL_REVIEW]` | Final review status transitions and notifications |

**Required Log Points:**

```
# At implementation start (multi-phase detection)
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] Detected multi-phase feature: {phases.total} phases
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] Creating feature branch: feature/task-{issueId} from main

# At each phase implementation
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] Creating phase branch: feature/task-{issueId}-phase-{N} from feature/task-{issueId}
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] PR #{prNumber} targeting feature branch: {phaseBranch} → {taskBranch}

# At phase merge (Telegram webhook)
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] Merging phase PR #{prNumber} to feature branch
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] Phase {current}/{total} complete

# At last phase merge
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] All phases complete, creating final PR
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] Final PR #{prNumber} created: feature/task-{issueId} → main
[LOG:FINAL_REVIEW] Status transition: PR Review → Final Review

# At final merge
[LOG:FINAL_REVIEW] Admin merging final PR #{prNumber}
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] Cleaning up branches for task-{issueId}
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] Deleted branch: feature/task-{issueId}-phase-{N}
[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH] Deleted branch: feature/task-{issueId}
[LOG:FINAL_REVIEW] Status transition: Final Review → Done

# Error cases
[LOG:ERROR] [FEATURE_BRANCH] Failed to create branch: {reason}
[LOG:ERROR] [FEATURE_BRANCH] Failed to create PR: {reason}
[LOG:ERROR] [FEATURE_BRANCH] Failed to merge: {reason}
[LOG:ERROR] [FEATURE_BRANCH] Failed to delete branch: {reason}
```

**Error Log Requirements:**
- Include issue number and phase context
- Include expected vs actual state
- Include suggested recovery steps
- Use `[LOG:ERROR]` with `[FEATURE_BRANCH]` context for grep filtering

## Files to Modify

### Core Agent Files
- `src/agents/core-agents/implementAgent/index.ts` - Feature branch creation, PR targeting (multi-phase only)
- `src/agents/core-agents/prReviewAgent/index.ts` - Minor updates for feature branch PRs (if needed)

### Infrastructure Files
- `src/server/project-management/config.ts` - Add "Final Review" status
- `src/server/project-management/adapters/github.ts` - May need minor updates for branch operations
- `src/server/project-management/types.ts` - Update status types if needed

### Merge/Webhook Handling
- `src/pages/api/telegram-webhook.ts` - Handle phase merges, final PR creation, Final Review merge

### Artifact/Phase Tracking
- `src/agents/lib/artifacts.ts` - Add task branch to artifact comment

### Notifications
- `src/agents/shared/notifications.ts` - Add Final Review notification with preview URL

### Documentation
- `docs/template/github-agents-workflow/multi-phase-features.md` - Update with new flow
- `docs/template/github-agents-workflow/workflow-overview.md` - Add single vs multi-phase section
- `docs/template/github-agents-workflow/feature-branch-workflow.md` - New comprehensive doc

### Workflow Review Command
- `.claude/commands/workflow-review.md` - Add feature branch flow validation

## Files NOT Modified (No Change)

These files remain unchanged because design docs and single-phase features use existing flow:

- `src/agents/core-agents/productDesignAgent/index.ts` - No change (PR to main)
- `src/agents/core-agents/techDesignAgent/index.ts` - No change (PR to main)
- Design review handling in Telegram webhook - No change

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test phase count detection (single vs multi)
   - Test branch name generation for both flows
   - Test artifact comment parsing with task branch field

2. **Integration Testing - Single-Phase**
   - Verify single-phase workflow unchanged
   - PR goes directly to main
   - No feature branch created
   - Status: Ready for Dev → PR Review → Done
   - No `[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH]` entries in log

3. **Integration Testing - Multi-Phase**
   - Feature branch created at implementation start
   - Phase PRs target feature branch
   - Final PR created after last phase
   - Status includes Final Review
   - Preview URL in notification
   - All `[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH]` entries present in log

4. **Manual Verification**
   - Run complete multi-phase workflow
   - Verify Vercel preview works for final PR
   - Test admin merge flow from Final Review
   - Verify branch cleanup after merge

5. **Log Verification with /workflow-review**
   - Run `/workflow-review {issueNumber}` after multi-phase workflow
   - Verify feature branch checklist passes:
     - [ ] Feature branch created for multi-phase
     - [ ] Phase PRs target feature branch (not main)
     - [ ] Final PR created after last phase
     - [ ] Final Review status set correctly
     - [ ] Branch cleanup after merge
   - Verify no errors in `[LOG:FEATURE_BRANCH]` entries
   - Verify all expected log points are present

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Detecting Multi-Phase Correctly
**Mitigation**: Use `phases.total > 1` check. This is already determined by Tech Design agent and stored in artifact comment.

### Risk 2: Preview Deployment Timing
**Mitigation**: Vercel creates previews for all PRs. May need to wait for deployment or poll for URL. Fallback to PR link if preview not ready.

### Risk 3: Branch Cleanup on Abandonment
**Mitigation**: Add cleanup logic for when issues are rejected or abandoned. Consider periodic cleanup job for orphaned branches.

### Risk 4: Existing Multi-Phase Issues In Progress
**Mitigation**: Document migration steps. Existing issues continue with old flow until completion. New issues use new flow.

### Risk 5: Telegram Webhook Complexity
**Mitigation**: Clearly separate handling for:
1. Design PR merge (to main) - no change
2. Single-phase implementation PR merge (to main) - no change
3. Multi-phase PR merge (to feature branch) - new logic
4. Final PR merge (feature to main) - new logic

   ├── Agent creates feature/issue-{id} branch from main
   ├── Agent implements feature
   ├── Agent creates PR → main (direct, no feature branch)
   ├── Status → PR Review
   ├── PR Review Agent reviews
   ├── Admin merges → main
   └── Status → Done

(No Final Review status - same as current behavior)
```

## Notes

### Trade-offs
- **Minimal changes**: Only implementation agent and merge handler change significantly
- **Design agents untouched**: No risk of breaking design review flow
- **Single-phase unchanged**: Fast path for simple features preserved
- **Multi-phase gets isolation**: Worth the extra PR for complex features

### Backward Compatibility
- Single-phase features: No change at all
- Design phase: No change at all
- Multi-phase implementation: New flow with feature branches
- Existing in-progress issues: Continue with old flow

### Critical Files for Implementation

The 6 most critical files for implementing this plan:

1. `src/agents/core-agents/implementAgent/index.ts` - Feature branch creation and PR targeting for multi-phase
2. `src/pages/api/telegram-webhook.ts` - Handle phase merges to feature branch, final PR creation, Final Review merge
3. `src/server/project-management/config.ts` - Add "Final Review" status
4. `src/agents/lib/artifacts.ts` - Track task branch in artifact comment
5. `src/agents/shared/notifications.ts` - Final Review notification with preview URL
6. `.claude/commands/workflow-review.md` - Add feature branch flow validation and new log markers
