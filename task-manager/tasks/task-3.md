# Task 3: Add "Ready to Merge" Status with Admin Approval Gate

**Summary:** Add a new workflow status between "PR Review Approved" and "Done" that requires admin approval before merging.

## Implementation Notes

Implemented differently than originally proposed - instead of a new "Ready to Merge" status with Implementor agent handling merges, we implemented a simpler Telegram-based flow:
> - PR Review Agent generates commit message on approval → saves to PR comment
> - Admin receives Telegram with Merge/Request Changes buttons
> - Merge button squash-merges with the saved commit message
> - Request Changes sends back to implementation
>
> This is simpler (no extra status needed) and more immediate (one-click merge from Telegram).
