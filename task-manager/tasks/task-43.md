# Task 43: Add Delete Button to Telegram Approval Message

**Summary:** Add a Delete button to the Telegram approval message so the admin can completely delete an item from MongoDB directly from Telegram.

## Details

When an item is created via the App or CLI and the admin sees the approval message in Telegram, there should be a Delete button alongside the existing Approve button. Clicking Delete should completely remove the item from MongoDB. This gives the admin a quick way to reject and clean up unwanted items without needing to open the web UI.
