# Bug Investigation Workflow

This document describes the complete bug investigation flow, from bug report submission through fix selection and routing.

## Overview

When a bug report is approved, it is **automatically routed** to the "Bug Investigation" column (no routing message is shown to the admin). The Bug Investigator agent then:

1. Investigates the bug using **read-only** tools (no code changes)
2. Saves investigation results to MongoDB `artifacts.decision` and posts a comment on the GitHub issue with root cause analysis and fix options
3. **If obvious fix** (`autoSubmit=true`): Auto-submits the recommended option, routes directly to Implementation, and sends a Telegram confirmation
4. **Otherwise**: Sends a Telegram notification with links to view the investigation and select a fix approach
5. Admin selects a fix option via the `/decision/:issueNumber` web UI
6. The bug is routed to **Technical Design** or **Implementation** based on the selected option
7. A Telegram confirmation is sent after submission with the selected option and next steps

## Auto-Routing on Approval

Unlike feature requests (which show a routing message), bug reports are automatically routed:

- **Feature requests**: Approval creates GitHub issue in "Backlog" + shows routing buttons
- **Bug reports**: Approval creates GitHub issue directly in "Bug Investigation" (no routing buttons)

This is configured via `initialStatus: STATUSES.bugInvestigation` in the bug report sync config (`src/server/github-sync/index.ts`).

## Bug Investigator Agent

### Agent Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Command** | `yarn agent:bug-investigator` |
| **Status Column** | Bug Investigation |
| **Identity** | Bug Investigator Agent |
| **Tools** | Read-only: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `WebFetch` |
| **Output** | Structured JSON (`BugInvestigationOutput`) |

### Agent Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **New** | Status = Bug Investigation, Review Status = empty | Fresh investigation |
| **Feedback** | Status = Bug Investigation, Review Status = Request Changes | Revise based on admin feedback |
| **Clarification** | Status = Bug Investigation, Review Status = Clarification Received | Continue after admin answers question |

### CLI Options

```bash
yarn agent:bug-investigator                    # Process all pending
yarn agent:bug-investigator --id <item-id>    # Process specific item
yarn agent:bug-investigator --dry-run         # Preview without saving
yarn agent:bug-investigator --stream          # Stream Claude output
```

### Output Schema

The agent outputs structured JSON with this format:

```typescript
interface FixOption {
  id: string;                              // "opt1", "opt2", etc.
  title: string;                           // Free text title
  description: string;                     // Detailed description
  destination: 'implement' | 'tech-design'; // Where to route
  complexity: 'S' | 'M' | 'L' | 'XL';    // Estimated size
  filesAffected: string[];                 // Files to modify
  tradeoffs?: string;                      // Trade-off analysis
  isRecommended: boolean;                  // Agent's recommendation
}

interface BugInvestigationOutput {
  rootCauseFound: boolean;
  confidence: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  rootCauseAnalysis: string;
  fixOptions: FixOption[];     // 1-N options
  filesExamined: string[];
  additionalLogsNeeded?: string;
  summary: string;
  autoSubmit?: boolean;        // Skip admin selection for obvious fixes
}
```

### Investigation Comment

The agent posts a formatted comment on the GitHub issue using the generic Agent Decision format:

```markdown
<!-- AGENT_DECISION_V1:bug-investigator -->
<!-- DECISION_META:{"type":"bug-fix","metadataSchema":[...],"routing":{...}} -->

## Decision Context

**Root Cause Found:** Yes
**Confidence:** High

### Root Cause Analysis
[Detailed analysis...]

### Options

#### opt1: Add null check **Recommended**
- **Complexity:** S
- **Destination:** Direct Implementation
- **Files Affected:** `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
[Description...]

#### opt2: Refactor auth flow
- **Complexity:** M
- **Destination:** Technical Design
- **Files Affected:** `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`, `src/server/auth.ts`
[Description...]
```

The `DECISION_META` includes a `routing` config that tells the submit handler how to auto-route the item based on the selected option's metadata.

## Fix Selection UI

After the investigation is posted, the admin selects a fix approach via the generic decision web UI.

### URL Format

```
/decision/:issueNumber?token=<generated-token>
```

The token is generated using `generateDecisionToken(issueNumber)` and included in the Telegram notification URL. Legacy `/bug-fix/:issueNumber` URLs redirect to `/decision/:issueNumber`.

### UI Flow

1. Page loads decision data from MongoDB (with GitHub issue comment fallback)
2. Displays root cause analysis context and fix options with metadata (complexity badges, file lists, etc.)
3. Admin selects a predefined option OR provides a custom solution
4. For custom solutions, admin also selects the routing destination
5. On submit, the selection is posted to the API

### API Endpoint

`POST /api/process/agent-decision/submitDecision`

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  issueNumber: number;
  token: string;
  selection: {
    selectedOptionId: string;      // "opt1", "opt2", or "custom"
    customSolution?: string;       // If custom
    customDestination?: string;    // If custom: "implement" | "tech-design"
    notes?: string;                // Optional additional notes
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success?: boolean;
  routedTo?: string;    // Status the item was routed to
  error?: string;
}
```

### What Happens on Submit

1. Validates the token
2. Saves selection to MongoDB `artifacts.decision.selection` and posts a **selection comment** on the GitHub issue (for display)
3. Reads the `routing` config from MongoDB decision (with comment fallback)
4. Resolves the target status from the selected option's metadata
5. Updates the item status to the destination:
   - `"Direct Implementation"` → "Ready for development"
   - `"Technical Design"` → "Technical Design"
6. Clears the Review Status (so the next agent picks it up)

If routing config is missing, the submit handler sets Review Status to "Approved" instead (for agents that handle their own post-decision logic).

## Telegram Notifications

### Investigation Ready (Manual Selection)

Sent when the Bug Investigator agent completes its investigation and admin selection is needed:

```
Agent (Bug Investigation): Decision Ready
Bug

Issue #60: "Login fails on Safari"
Options: 3

Summary:
[investigation summary]

[Choose Recommended] [Choose Option] [View Issue] [Request Changes]
```

- **Choose Recommended**: One-click shortcut that selects the agent's recommended option via `chooseRecommendedOption()` -- available in both Telegram and UI
- **Choose Option**: Opens `/decision/:issueNumber` web UI for manual selection
- **View Issue**: Opens the GitHub issue
- **Request Changes**: Sets Review Status to "Request Changes" (triggers feedback mode)

### Auto-Submitted (Obvious Fix)

Sent when the agent auto-submits an obvious fix without requiring admin selection:

```
Agent (Bug Investigation): Auto-Submitted
Bug

Issue #60: "Login fails on Safari"

Selected: Add null check for auth token
Routed to: Ready for development

Obvious fix auto-submitted. The implementation agent will pick this up next.
```

### Submission Confirmed

Sent after the admin submits a fix selection via the web UI:

```
Decision Submitted: Confirmed
Bug

Issue #60: "Login fails on Safari"

Selected: Add null check for auth token
Routed to: Ready for development

The next agent will pick this up automatically.
```

## E2E Flow Diagram

```
1. Bug enters "Bug Investigation" status (auto-routed on approval)
   |
2. Bug Investigator agent runs
   |- Investigates codebase (read-only)
   |- Posts investigation comment on GitHub issue (Agent Decision format)
   |
   +--> [Auto-Submit Path] (autoSubmit=true, high confidence, S complexity)
   |    |- Posts selection comment on issue
   |    |- Routes directly to "Ready for development"
   |    '- Sends Telegram: "Auto-Submitted" confirmation
   |    |
   |    '--> 6. Implementation agent picks up
   |
   +--> [Manual Selection Path] (normal flow)
        |- Sends Telegram: [Choose Option] [View Issue] [Request Changes]
        |
        3. Admin clicks "Choose Option" -> Opens /decision/:issueNumber UI
        |
        4. Admin selects option (or provides custom) -> Submits
        |
        5. API processes submission
        |- Posts selection comment on issue
        |- Reads routing config from DECISION_META
        |- Routes to destination (Tech Design or Implementation)
        |- Clears Review Status
        '- Sends Telegram: submission confirmation with next steps
        |
        6. Next agent picks up with full context from issue comments
```
