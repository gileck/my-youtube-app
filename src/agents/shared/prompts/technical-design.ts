## Your Task

Create a Technical Design document. The size of your output should match the complexity of the feature - simple features get simple designs, complex features get detailed designs.

**Required sections:**
1. **Size & Complexity** - Effort (S/M/L/XL) and complexity (Low/Medium/High)
2. **Overview** - Brief technical approach (1-2 sentences for small features)
3. **Files to Create/Modify** - List of files with brief description of changes

## Size Estimation Criteria

Use these criteria to determine the appropriate size. **Size is about total effort, NOT about which layers are touched.** A feature needing schema + API + UI is completely normal for M size.

**S (Small)** - Few hours of work
- Simple, focused change
- Examples: Add button, fix styling, update text, add field to existing form

**M (Medium)** - 1-2 days of work (SINGLE PR)
- Standard feature with straightforward implementation
- Can include: new collection, CRUD APIs, new route with components
- Examples: Add notes feature (collection + 4 endpoints + list/form UI), new settings page, simple entity management

**L (Large)** - 3-5 days of work (REQUIRES PHASES)
- Complex feature with significant logic or many edge cases
- Multiple interconnected components with complex state
- Examples: Advanced filtering/search system, complex multi-step wizard, feature with extensive validation rules

**XL (Epic)** - Week+ of work (REQUIRES PHASES)
- Major new capability or system
- Significant architectural decisions
- Examples: Real-time collaboration, complex integrations, major workflow system

**Key insight:** A feature with schema + API + UI is typically M size (single PR). Only split into phases when the TOTAL work is genuinely large, not because it touches multiple layers.

**Optional sections (include only when relevant):**
- **Data Model** - Only if new collections or schema changes needed
- **API Changes** - Only if new endpoints or modifications needed
- **State Management** - Only if non-trivial state handling needed
- **Implementation Notes** - Only for complex logic that needs explanation

## Multi-PR Workflow (for L/XL features ONLY)

**CRITICAL: For L or XL size features, you MUST split the implementation into phases.**

Each phase:
- Should be independently mergeable (can be deployed on its own)
- Should be size S or M (not L or XL)
- Should result in a single PR
- Should have clear dependencies (which phases must complete before this one)

If the feature is L or XL:
1. Split it into 2-5 implementation phases
2. Each phase should be a complete, testable unit of work
3. Order phases so earlier phases don't depend on later ones
4. Include the phases in your structured output

**Phase Breakdown Strategy:**

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT split by layer (database → API → UI). A typical M-size feature includes all layers in ONE PR.

Only split into phases when the feature is genuinely L/XL. When you do split, split by **complexity levels** - each phase delivers a WORKING end-to-end feature, just at increasing sophistication.

**Phase split by complexity (CORRECT approach):**
- **Phase 1: Foundation** - Simple working version (basic schema + basic API + basic UI). Not production-polished, but functional end-to-end.
- **Phase 2: Add Complexity** - Richer fields, more endpoints, better UI, handle more cases
- **Phase 3: More Complexity** - Advanced features, edge cases, polish, optimizations

**Bad phase split (by layer - DON'T DO THIS):**
- Phase 1: Just database schema - nothing works yet
- Phase 2: Just API endpoints - still nothing usable
- Phase 3: Just UI - finally works

**Example: Notifications System (L/XL)**

- **Phase 1: Foundation**
  - Schema: Basic fields (message, read, createdAt)
  - API: list, markRead
  - UI: Simple list
  - What Works: User can see and mark notifications

- **Phase 2: Add Complexity**
  - Schema: Add types, priority, actions
  - API: filtering, markAllRead, delete
  - UI: Filters, actions, badges
  - What Works: Richer notification experience

- **Phase 3: Advanced**
  - Schema: Add channels, preferences
  - API: real-time, preferences API
  - UI: Real-time updates, settings
  - What Works: Full-featured system

Each phase is independently mergeable, deployable, and delivers increasing value.

**Example: When to use phases vs single PR**

- **Notes feature (collection + CRUD + UI)** - Size: M, Phases: No
  - Reasoning: Standard pattern, 1-2 days work
- **User preferences page** - Size: M, Phases: No
  - Reasoning: Straightforward settings UI
- **Complex notifications with types, real-time, preferences** - Size: L, Phases: Yes
  - Reasoning: High complexity, split by sophistication
- **Multi-step workflow builder** - Size: XL, Phases: Yes
  - Reasoning: Very complex, needs incremental delivery

**IMPORTANT**: Only include phases for L/XL features. For S/M features, do NOT include phases - they will be implemented in a single PR.

## Research Strategy

Explore the codebase:
1. Read existing similar features to understand patterns
2. Check \`src/apis/\` for API patterns
3. Check \`src/server/database/collections/\` for database patterns
4. Look at \`src/client/routes/\` for component patterns

**Data availability check**: Before specifying UI that displays data, verify the schema/types have the required fields. If missing, note "requires schema change" or remove the feature from design.

## Output Format

Provide your response as structured JSON with these fields:
- **design**: Complete Technical Design document in markdown format (same structure as before)
- **phases** (L/XL features ONLY): Array of implementation phases (see schema below). Leave empty/null for S/M features.
- **comment**: High-level implementation plan to post as GitHub comment (3-5 bullet points). Use markdown numbered list with each item on a NEW LINE

**Phase schema (for L/XL features only):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "order": 1,                    // Phase number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
  "name": "Database Schema",     // Short phase name
  "description": "...",          // What this phase implements
  "files": ["src/...", "docs/..."],  // Source files to modify + relevant docs
  "estimatedSize": "S"           // S or M (never L/XL for a single phase)
}
\`\`\`

**IMPORTANT - Files Array Content:**
The \`files\` array should include BOTH:
1. **Source files to create/modify** - The actual implementation files (e.g., \`src/apis/...\`, \`src/client/...\`)
2. **Relevant documentation** - Docs the implementor should read before implementing this phase:
   - \`docs/\` files for detailed patterns (e.g., \`docs/mongodb-usage.md\`, \`docs/theming.md\`)
   - \`docs/template/project-guidelines/\` files for coding guidelines (e.g., \`docs/template/project-guidelines/state-management-guidelines.md\`)

Select docs based on what the phase touches:
- Database work → \`docs/template/mongodb-usage.md\`, \`docs/template/project-guidelines/mongodb-usage.md\`
- API endpoints → \`docs/template/api-endpoint-format.md\`, \`docs/template/project-guidelines/client-server-communications.md\`
- UI components → \`docs/template/theming.md\`, \`docs/template/project-guidelines/react-component-organization.md\`, \`docs/template/project-guidelines/shadcn-usage.md\`
- State management → \`docs/template/state-management.md\`, \`docs/template/project-guidelines/state-management-guidelines.md\`
- Authentication → \`docs/template/authentication.md\`, \`docs/template/project-guidelines/user-access.md\`
- Offline/PWA → \`docs/offline-pwa-support.md\`, \`docs/react-query-mutations.md\`

Keep the design concise. A small feature might only need a short list of files. A large feature needs more detail.

## Implementation Plan Section (REQUIRED)

Your technical design MUST include a "## Implementation Plan" section with high-level, actionable steps.

**For S/M features (single-phase):**
- Provide a single numbered list of implementation steps
- Each step should be a clear, actionable task
- Include file paths and what to do with them
- Order steps so each builds on the previous

**For L/XL features (multi-phase):**
- Organize steps by phase
- Each phase should have its own numbered list
- Steps within a phase should be self-contained

**Step guidelines:**
- Keep steps high-level (not line-by-line detailed)
- Each step should be actionable: "Create X", "Add Y to Z", "Update W"
- Include relevant file paths
- Order steps logically (dependencies first)

Example Implementation Plan for S/M feature:
\`\`\`markdown
## Implementation Plan

1. Create auth types file at \`src/apis/auth/types.ts\`
2. Create login handler at \`src/apis/auth/handlers/login.ts\`
3. Add API route at \`src/pages/api/process/auth_login.ts\`
4. Create useLogin hook in \`src/client/features/auth/hooks.ts\`
5. Update auth feature exports in \`src/client/features/auth/index.ts\`
6. Run yarn checks to verify
\`\`\`

Example Implementation Plan for L/XL feature:
\`\`\`markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema

\`\`\`

## Output Format Example

**GOOD comment example:**
\`\`\`
Here's the technical design:
1. Size M - single PR with new collection, 2 API endpoints, and list/form UI
2. New \`notes\` MongoDB collection with userId index for per-user queries
3. Two endpoints: \`notes/list\` (GET with pagination) and \`notes/create\` (POST with optimistic update)
4. New NotesRoute page using React Query for data fetching and Zustand for draft state
5. Follows existing patterns from the items feature for consistency
\`\`\`

**BAD comment example (too generic, avoid this):**
\`\`\`
Here's the technical design:
1. Created the design document
2. Listed the files
3. Added implementation plan
\`\`\`

## Output Format

Provide your response as structured JSON with these fields:
- **design**: COMPLETE revised Technical Design document in markdown format (entire document, not just changes)
- **comment**: High-level summary of what you changed to post as GitHub comment (3-5 bullet points). Use markdown numbered list with each item on a NEW LINE

Do NOT output just the changes in design - output the entire revised document. Keep it concise.

## Output Format Example

**GOOD comment example:**
\`\`\`
Here's what I revised in the technical design:
1. [Feedback: missing pagination] → Added cursor-based pagination to the list endpoint with 20-item default
2. [Feedback: no error handling for duplicate entries] → Added unique index on (userId, name) and 409 conflict response
3. Updated implementation plan to reflect the new pagination and uniqueness requirements
