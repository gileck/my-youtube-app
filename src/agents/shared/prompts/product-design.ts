    return `## Design Mock Options

In addition to the written design document, create **2-3 design mock options** as interactive React pages. Each option represents a different UI/UX approach to the feature.

**IMPORTANT — Write mock files directly:**
You have write access. You MUST write each mock option as a React component file BEFORE producing structured output. The files will be deployed to a Vercel preview URL for the admin to review.

**File structure:**
- Each option component: \`src/pages/design-mocks/components/issue-${issueNumber}-{optId}.tsx\` (e.g., \`issue-${issueNumber}-optA.tsx\`)
- Main page with tabs: \`src/pages/design-mocks/issue-${issueNumber}.tsx\`

**Requirements for mock components:**
- Each option must be a self-contained React function component (default export)
- Use ONLY shadcn/ui components imported from \`@/client/components/template/ui/\` — available components: Button, Card, Input, Label, Badge, Avatar, Select, Switch, Textarea, Dialog, Sheet, Separator, Skeleton, DropdownMenu, RadioGroup, Alert, Collapsible, Calendar
- Use semantic theme tokens for all colors (\`bg-background\`, \`text-foreground\`, \`bg-muted\`, \`text-muted-foreground\`, \`bg-primary\`, \`text-primary-foreground\`, \`border\`, etc.) — NEVER hardcode colors
- Design mobile-first for ~400px viewport (use \`max-w-md mx-auto\`)
- Include realistic content appropriate to the feature (not lorem ipsum)
- Keep each component focused — one clear design approach per option
- Import React hooks (useState, etc.) from 'react' as needed

**Props — viewState and colorMode:**
The mock preview shell passes two props to the main page component. You MUST accept and forward these to each option component:
- \`viewState\`: \`'populated' | 'empty' | 'loading'\` — controls which state to render
  - \`'populated'\`: Show the component with realistic sample data (DEFAULT)
  - \`'empty'\`: Show the empty state (no items, no data, blank slate with helpful message/action)
  - \`'loading'\`: Show the loading/skeleton state
- \`colorMode\`: \`'light' | 'dark'\` — the current color mode (the shell wraps your component in a \`dark\` CSS class container, so semantic tokens like \`bg-background\` automatically adapt — you don't need to handle this manually, just make sure you use semantic tokens and NOT hardcoded colors)

Each option component signature should be:
\`\`\`tsx
export default function OptionA({ viewState = 'populated' }: { viewState?: 'populated' | 'empty' | 'loading' }) {
  if (viewState === 'loading') return <LoadingSkeleton />;
  if (viewState === 'empty') return <EmptyState />;
  return <PopulatedView />;
}
\`\`\`

The main page component must accept and forward these props:
\`\`\`tsx
export default function MockPage({ viewState, colorMode }: { viewState?: string; colorMode?: string }) {
  // ... forward viewState to each option component
  <OptionA viewState={viewState as 'populated' | 'empty' | 'loading'} />
}
\`\`\`

**Main page structure (\`src/pages/design-mocks/issue-${issueNumber}.tsx\`):**
- Import each option component using React.lazy and dynamic import
- Render tabs (Option A / Option B / etc.) with useState for tab switching
- Each option rendered inside a mobile-width container (\`max-w-md mx-auto\`)
- Wrap lazy components in React.Suspense with a loading fallback
- Accept \`viewState\` and \`colorMode\` props, forward \`viewState\` to option components

**After writing mock files, verify they compile:**
- Run \`npx tsc --noEmit src/pages/design-mocks/issue-${issueNumber}.tsx\` to check for TypeScript errors
- Fix any compilation errors before proceeding

**Each option should differ meaningfully** — for example:
- Option A: Minimalist approach with fewer elements
- Option B: Feature-rich approach with more detail
- Option C: Alternative layout or interaction pattern

**IMPORTANT:** Only write files to \`src/pages/design-mocks/\`. Do NOT modify any other files in the project.
**IMPORTANT:** Write all mock files BEFORE producing the structured JSON output.`;

Create 2-3 design mock options that show different UI/UX approaches for this feature. Each option should be meaningfully different.

## Research Strategy

Before creating the mocks, explore the codebase:
1. Read \`src/client/routes/index.ts\` to understand the routing structure
2. If a page is mentioned, find and read that component
3. Look at similar existing features for patterns
4. Check relevant types in \`src/apis/\` if the feature needs API work

## Output Format Example

**GOOD comment example:**
\`\`\`
Here are the design mock options:
1. Option A: Minimalist card layout — focuses on simplicity with a clean single-column view
2. Option B: Feature-rich dashboard — includes filters, sorting, and inline editing
3. Option C: Conversational UI — step-by-step guided flow with progressive disclosure
4. Recommended: Option A for its simplicity and mobile-first approach
\`\`\`

**BAD comment example (too generic, avoid this):**
\`\`\`
Here are 3 options:
1. Option A
2. Option B
3. Option C

## Your Task

1. Carefully read all feedback comments to understand the full context
2. **Look for the most recent "✅ Addressed Feedback" marker** - this shows where the last revision cycle ended
3. **Address ALL feedback comments that appear AFTER the marker** (there may be multiple comments covering different areas)
4. If no marker exists, this is the first revision - address all feedback comments
5. Research any areas mentioned in the feedback
6. Revise the Product Design to address all the relevant feedback points
7. Keep the output size proportional to the feature complexity

## Output Format

Provide your response as structured JSON with these fields:
- **design**: COMPLETE revised Product Design document in markdown format (entire document, not just changes)
- **comment**: High-level summary of what you changed to post as GitHub comment (3-5 bullet points). Use markdown numbered list with each item on a NEW LINE

Do NOT output just the changes in design - output the entire revised document. Keep it concise.

## Output Format Example

**GOOD comment example:**
\`\`\`
Here's what I revised in the product design:
1. [Feedback: missing error states] → Added explicit error handling for network failures and invalid input
2. [Feedback: touch targets too small] → Increased all interactive elements to 44px minimum
3. Kept the overall flow unchanged, only addressed the specific feedback points
