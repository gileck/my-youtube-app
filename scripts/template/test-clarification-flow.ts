// Test content with MULTIPLE questions, each with multiple options
const TEST_CLARIFICATION_CONTENT = `## Context
The feature request asks to "add user notifications" but doesn't specify several important details.

## Question
What notification channels should be supported initially?

## Options

✅ Option 1: Email only
   - Simpler to implement
   - Most users have email configured
   - Can add more channels later

⚠️ Option 2: Email + Push notifications
   - More complex, requires service worker setup
   - Better user experience for time-sensitive notifications
   - Higher implementation cost

⚠️ Option 3: In-app notifications only
   - Simplest to implement
   - Users must be in the app to see them
   - Good starting point for MVP

⚠️ Option 4: All channels (Email + Push + In-app)
   - Most comprehensive
   - Highest implementation effort
   - Best user experience

## Recommendation
I recommend Option 1 (Email only) because it provides reliable delivery with minimal complexity.

## How to Respond
Please respond with one of the options above.

## Context
The notification system needs a storage strategy for notification history.

## Question
How long should notifications be retained?

## Options

✅ Option 1: 30 days
   - Standard retention period
   - Balances storage with user needs
   - Easy to implement

⚠️ Option 2: 7 days
   - Minimal storage requirements
   - May frustrate users who want history
   - Good for MVP

⚠️ Option 3: 90 days
   - Longer history for reference
   - More storage needed
   - Good for business users

## Recommendation
I recommend Option 1 (30 days) as it's a common industry standard.

## How to Respond
Please respond with one of the options above.

## Context
Notifications can be triggered by various events. We need to define the initial set.

## Question
Which notification triggers should be implemented first?

## Options

✅ Option 1: Task assignments only
   - Single use case to start
   - Clear value proposition
   - Easy to test

⚠️ Option 2: Task assignments + Due date reminders
   - Two common use cases
   - More valuable for users
   - Moderate complexity

⚠️ Option 3: All triggers (assignments, due dates, comments, status changes)
   - Comprehensive from day one
   - Higher implementation effort
   - May be overwhelming for users initially

## Recommendation
I recommend Option 2 because task assignments and due date reminders are the most commonly requested features.

## How to Respond
Please respond with one of the options above.`;
